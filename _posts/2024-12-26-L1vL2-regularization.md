This post explores the key differences between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, two techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Both methods add a penalty term to the loss function, but they do so in different ways. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the right regularization technique based on your model's needs.

## L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function. This penalty encourages sparsity, effectively driving some coefficients to zero. As a result, L1 regularization can perform feature selection, making it ideal for situations where some features are irrelevant or redundant.

### Formula for L1 Regularization:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Loss}_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{i} |w_i|
$$

Where:
- \( w_i \) represents the model coefficients
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty

### Key Characteristics:
- Performs feature selection by reducing some coefficients to zero.
- Useful for high-dimensional datasets where some features are not useful.
- Can result in sparse models, which are easier to interpret.

## L2 Regularization (Ridge)

In contrast, L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients to the loss function. This penalty discourages large coefficients but does not set them to zero. As a result, L2 regularization is ideal when you believe all features should contribute to the model, but you want to prevent any single feature from dominating.

### Formula for L2 Regularization:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Loss}_{\text{original}} + \lambda \sum_{i} w_i^2
$$

Where:
- \( w_i \) represents the model coefficients
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty

### Key Characteristics:
- Shrinks coefficients toward zero but does not eliminate them.
- Helps manage multicollinearity by evenly distributing the effect of correlated features.
- Generally leads to more stable models in the presence of highly correlated features.

## Key Differences Between L1 and L2 Regularization

### 1. **Sparsity and Feature Selection:**
L1 regularization can set some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing irrelevant features from the model. In contrast, L2 regularization never sets coefficients to zero but shrinks them toward zero, preserving all features.

### 2. **Handling Multicollinearity:**
L2 regularization is more effective at handling multicollinearity by distributing the effects of correlated variables more evenly. L1 regularization, on the other hand, may arbitrarily select one feature from a set of correlated features and discard others.

### 3. **Optimization Landscape:**
L2 regularization leads to a convex optimization problem, making it easier to solve compared to the non-convex problem that L1 regularization can introduce.

### 4. **Use Cases:**
- **L1 Regularization** is useful when you expect many features to be irrelevant and want to perform automatic feature selection.
- **L2 Regularization** is ideal when all features are expected to contribute to the prediction, and you want to avoid overfitting caused by excessively large weights.

## Combining Both: Elastic Net

Elastic Net combines the penalties of both L1 and L2 regularization. This approach is useful when you have a dataset with many features and you suspect there may be correlations among them. Elastic Net offers the benefits of both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a flexible approach to regularization.
