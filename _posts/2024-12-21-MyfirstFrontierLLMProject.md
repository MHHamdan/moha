Welcome to my first LM experiment! 
I’m so excited to dive into this and share what I’ve learned so far. This is all about understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) work and how we can start using them effectively. If some of this feels familiar, great! If not, don’t worry—it’ll all make sense soon enough.
