Welcome to my first **LM experiment**!  
I’m so excited to dive into this and share what I’ve learned so far. This is all about understanding how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** work and how we can start using them effectively. If some of this feels familiar, great! If not, don’t worry—it’ll all make sense soon enough.

## Getting Started with Prompts

The first thing we need to understand is how **LLMs interpret instructions**. There are two key types of prompts:

### 1. System Prompt
This is like setting the stage. It tells the model the **context of the conversation**, what kind of task it’s performing, and even the **tone** to use. 

> For example, in this experiment, the system prompt is set to make the model act as an assistant that analyzes websites and summarizes their content.  

We’ll play around with this more as we go, and it’s fascinating to see how changing it can influence the responses.

### 2. User Prompt
This is where we give **specific instructions** or ask a question. It’s the actual **conversation starter**.

> In this case, the user prompt is asking the model to summarize the content of a website.  

Together, these prompts guide the model to generate responses that are **relevant** and **structured**.
