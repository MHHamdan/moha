This post outlines fundamental derivatives of various functions, which are essential in calculus. In the context of backpropagation in neural networks, these derivatives represent the mathematical foundation for computing gradients.

### Backpropagation in Neural Networks

Backpropagation is the process of training a neural network by adjusting weights based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (iteration). The main goal is to minimize the error by using the gradient descent algorithm. Here's how the derivatives shown in the image relate to backpropagation:

1. **Chain Rule**: The chain rule of calculus is pivotal in backpropagation. It allows us to compute the derivative of a composite function. For example, if we have \( z = f(g(x)) \), the chain rule states that:
   \[
   \frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx}
   \]

2. **Activation Functions**: The derivatives listed (e.g., exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric) are often used as activation functions or in the loss function calculations. Understanding their derivatives is crucial for calculating the gradients:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x
   \]
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \log x = \frac{1}{x}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x
   \]

3. **Gradient Descent**: During backpropagation, we need to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. These gradients are used to update the weights to minimize the loss. For instance:
   - If the loss function involves an exponential term \( e^{f(x)} \), its derivative \( e^{f(x)} f'(x) \) will be part of the gradient computation.

4. **Complex Functions**: For complex functions, such as compositions involving trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, their derivatives are essential. For example:
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \tan x = \sec^2 x
   \]
   \[
   \frac{d}{dx} \sin^{-1} x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
   \]

### Application in Backpropagation

- **Forward Pass**: Compute the output of each neuron in the network.
- **Loss Computation**: Calculate the loss using a suitable loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
- **Backward Pass**:
  - Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output.
  - Use the chain rule to propagate this gradient backward through the network, layer by layer, to compute the gradient with respect to each weight.
  - Apply the derivative rules (as shown in the image) to determine these gradients accurately.

In summary, these derivatives form the building blocks for calculating gradients during backpropagation. Accurate gradient computation is vital for effectively training neural networks and optimizing their performance.
