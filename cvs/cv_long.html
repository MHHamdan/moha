Courses-based Projects

    • Project name: Deep Tsundoku, August 2022 - September 2022. Role: Team member 
About the project: Deep Tsundoku is a bookshelf app that combines the serendipity of looking through real books with modern ways to find information. GitHub code is here, and Huggingface is hosting the model here. 
    • Project name: Corpus-based PP-attachment Ambiguity Resolution in Arabic script, Aug 2015. Role: team member. The project focuses on two significant linguistic ambiguities: prepositional phrase attachment and word sense ambiguity. We present a new supervised learning technique for PP-attachment based on a corpus that has been semantically annotated. King Abdul- Aziz University, Jeddah, KSA. Other members: Ebtesam S.Bashammakh2 Areej Y. Bayahya3, Majed Al- Ghamdi, Dr. Imtiaz H. Khan5 P.G. Student, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Ebtesam.BaShammakh@gmail.com, Arigyahya@gmail.com, mj87mj@hotmail.com.
    • Project name: Handwritten Recognition in Arabic scripts based using Hidden Markov Model Approach, Aug 2015, Role: Team member. About the project: HMM-based offline cursive Arabic handwriting recognition is addressed. The suggested method uses embedded training-based HMMs to improve character models by considering character context. Analytical without explicit segmentation, retrieved features prior to baseline estimation are statistical and structural to combine text and word image pixel distribution characteristics. King Abdul-Aziz University, Jeddah, KSA Another member: Dr.Abdullah A. S. Basuhail2 P.G. Student, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of  Computing and Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, mh2015kaugmail.com, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia abasuhailkau.edu.sa.
    • Project name: An Evaluation Code Metrics in C# based systems, Aug 2016, King Abdul-Aziz University, Jeddah, KSA. Role: team member. About the project: The difficulty of keeping code trustworthy and maintainable rises in tandem with the complexity of modern software programmes. A group of software metrics known as "code metrics" can help programmers get insight into their work. The use of code metrics helps programmers determine which classes and/or methods need to be refactored or tested more carefully. During software development, teams can track progress, understand the current state of a project, and identify hazards.  Another member: Dr. Wajdi Al Jedaibi2 P.G. Student, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, mh2015kaugmail.com. Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia waljedaibigmail.com.
    • Project name: Detection  Hidden  Characters from  Vehicles'  Plates in  Saudi Arabia, Aug 2015, King Abdul- Aziz University, Jeddah, KSA. Role: team member. About the project: Compared to the methods utilized with license plates abroad, those in Saudi Arabia are less complicated. Recognization trees can be simplified if only a subset of characters is used. When tested with data derived from actual license plates, the devised approach yielded a perfect recognition rate for all characters recognized by the system. Another member: Dr. Abdullah A. S. Basuhail P.G. Student, Department of Computer   Science,  Faculty of  Computing and  Information Technology, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, mh2015kaugmail.com.
