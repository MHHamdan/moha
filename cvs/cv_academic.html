Professional Summary
Innovative researcher in Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV), holding a Ph.D. from École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), Montreal, Canada. Specializing in deep learning-driven document recognition, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and advanced NLP-CV integration, I pioneered the HAND architecture, achieving below 5% error rates on complex handwritten document datasets. My expertise spans vision transformers (ViT), hierarchical attention networks, GANs, NLP-based language modeling, segmentation-free OCR, and multilingual text recognition. I have a robust track record of peer-reviewed publications (IEEE TPAMI, Pattern Recognition, IJDAR, TIP, Array) and demonstrated success in fostering research collaborations, managing laboratory infrastructures, deploying scalable MLOps pipelines, and mentoring fellow researchers. I am committed to leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies in deep learning, multimodal data integration, and sensor fusion to advance both industry and academic frontiers.
